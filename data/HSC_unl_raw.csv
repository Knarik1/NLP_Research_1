67265,RCX,Schreiben in das serielle Flash ist extrem langsam,"Der Verwaltungsaufwand zum schreiben in das serielle Flash ist extrem hoch. Die Schreibleistung z.B. auf dem NXDB500-SYS betr\xc3\xa4gt etwa 23 kb/s. (Schreibdurchsatz von Drv_Sfl). Der erreichte Nettodurchsatz betr\xc3\xa4gt aber weniger als 1 kb/s.\n\nUrsache ist zum einen der Flash Translation Layer (FTL). Dieser wird ben\xc3\xb6tigt um stets (bei Power Down) konsistente Daten zu haben. Weiterhin sorgt er f\xc3\xbcr eine gleichm\xc3\xa4\xc3\x9figen Abnutzung der einzelnen Flashseiten. Der FTL f\xc3\xbchrt zu einer Erh\xc3\xb6hung der Schreibzugriffe um den Faktor 3 bis 4.\n\nEine weitere Ursache ist die Implementierung des FAT12.\nIn den standardm\xc3\xa4\xc3\x9fig benutzten Gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fen (z.B. die H\xc3\xa4lfter des seriellen Flashes oder kleiner) ist 1 Cluster genau 1 Sektor gro\xc3\x9f. Ist ein Sektor vollgeschrieben, f\xc3\xa4ngt damit ein neuer Cluster an. Die ge\xc3\xa4nderte File Allocation Table (FAT) wird dann sofort in das Flash geschrieben. Beim FAT12 sind dies 2 Sektoren in doppelter Ausf\xc3\xbchrung (FAT wird doppelt gef\xc3\xbchrt). Dieser Schreibzugriff (2 mal 2 sind 4 Sektoren) wird gleich darauf noch ein Mal ausgef\xc3\xbcrt.\n\nDies f\xc3\xbchrt beim Schreiben eines (Daten-)sektors dazu, dass effektiv 9 Sektoren geschrieben werden m\xc3\xbcssen! Bei einer Datei von 10 kb (20 Sektoren) sind das dann 180 Schreibzugriffe.\n\nWeitere Optimierungsm\xc3\xb6glichkeiten sind das vergr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fern der Sektorgr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fe (z. B. 528 Byte) oder gr\xc3\xb6\xc3\x9fere Cluster (z. B. 4 Sektoren pro Cluster anstatt einem).",

80350,PSPNM,firmware may write to DPM even if not allowed by handshake flags in case a device is no longer in data exchange,"if a device leaves the cyclic data exchange the firmware may directly invalidate the data of the device in DPM input area, even if the firmware is not allowed to write according to handshake flags.",
80349,PSPNM,update to new TCP/IP stack version 2.1.19.0,due to some changes in EthernetInterface task an update is required (when using loadable module),
80348,PSPNM,when DMA mode is active applications values for IOxS are not copied from DPM to IO-Devices,when DMA is active the IOxS interface does not work as expected.,
80347,PSPNM,when DMA mode is active the values for status bitlists and IOPS may not always be correctly copied to DPM Input area,when DMA is enabled and IOPS interface is used not all values are copied by firmware into DPM.,
80346,PSPNM,communication error cleared for short time when connection to first IO-Device is established,"if several IO-Devices are configured and none is connected an error is reported by the firmware. If now a single of the configured IO-Devices is connected and the communication is established firmware clears communication error and error flag bit. One second later it sets communication error TLR_E_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT (0xC0000142) again, since not all slaves are connected yet.\nI would expect communication error to stay set, until all slaves are connected.\n",

80334,PSPNM,some GSDML datatypes are not supported by the swapping functionality of firmware,"safety IO-Devices might use the datatype ""F_Message_Trailer_4"" or ""F_Message_Trailer_5"" as datatype of a submodule.\nAs the data type is part of configuration database the firmware shall support this data types and not simply report ""generic configuration fault"" if such an IO-Device is configured.",
80333,PSPNM,Ethernet Activity LED shall not be always on but shall blink if there is data exchanged,current IO-Contoller uses regular 2PortSwitch which is part of rcX.\nSome customers complain about how Activity LED is handled (always on) which differs from IO-Device (blinking).,
80332,PSPNM,packet configuration with duplicate ARUUID is accepted but should not,"if the packet configuration contains multiple IO-Devices and they use the same ARUUID this is a configuration fault. However the firmware does not detect this fault and uses the faulty configuration leading to strange behavior (e.g. ApplReady not accepted, communication not established)",
80331,PSPNM,Number of IOPS entries in Extended Status is not cleared with new configuration,Controller is configured by packets with IOPS enabled (see PSPNM-442 for packets).\nOn each new reconfiguration (Channel Init + configuration packets) the Number of IOPS Entries in Extended Status is increased by the expected value.,

80327,PSPNM,DCP Ident request is sometimes not sent to device when FastStartUp is enabled,Sometimes controller does not send Ident requests to device with enabled FSU (NIC 50-REFO in this test).\nIt seems to happen after a short cyclic communication phase (see end of the trace).,
80325,PSPNM,firmware shall check IP-addresses of IO-Devices inside database to reject database with invalid IP addresses,there were several support calls and inhouse problems with Profinet IO-Controller.\nWhen using Sycon.net bus scan the IP address is incorrectly set to 0.0.0.0 inside database.\nsuch a database shall not be accepted as no communication can be established anyway.,
80323,PSPNM,"DCP IdentifyResponses with unknown, padded blocks are ignored",if the IO-Controller receive a DCP IdentifyRsp that contains an unknown block and if this block needs alignment the IO-Controller will ignore the whole response.,
80322,PSPNM,feature: add support for user application to send DCP GET Requests,customer would like to find out the VendorID/DeviceID of a Profinet IO-Device in the network. Using other services (topology based information) he has knowledge of the MAC Address (and maybe the NameOfStation).\n\nto find out the VendorID and DeviceID he currently needs to do a bus scan (identify all IO-Devices) and look for the MAC address in the responses.\n\nThis would be much easier if DCP GET would be supported by IO-Controller firmware,
80321,PSPNM,get switch statistics does not work correctly when link state changes,"the new service Get_Switch_Statistics does not work correctly.\nwhen a link of port 1 changes from UP to DOWN and the data is read the stack still states ""link up"".\n\nin addition the handling of portNumber is incorrectly implemented. port 0 according to IO-Controller API is mapped to port 0 of DrvEdd which is incorrect (shall be port 1 of DrvEdd).\nThis leads to strange ulValidFlags for Port0",
80310,PSPNM,no parameters sent to submodules that report submodule state substitute during connection establishment,"On Connect request device responds with Module Diff block.\nModule in slot 0 and all its submodules are set to substitute.\nController does not send parameters, which were configured for slot 0 subslot 1.\n\nIf all modules are correct, controller sends the parameters.\n\nI have expected, that a substitute module is handled similar to a correct module by controller.",

Then, we have the same issue as described in bullet 2. Since the encap session and the class3 connection are bound to each other, it may also be a good idea to tear it down.

The initial value loaded into the Inactivity/Watchdog Timer is either 10,000 milliseconds (10 seconds) or the expected_packet_rate multiplied by the connection_timeout_multiplier, depending on which value is numerically greater1. If the expected_packet_rate attribute multiplied by the connection_timeout_multiplier is greater than 10,000, then the expected_packet_rate multiplied by the connection_timeout_multiplier is used. Otherwise, 10,000 (10 seconds) is used. This is referred to as the preconsumption timeout value. This value is used because a Connection may transition to the Established state before all endpoints are fully configured</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems like the current implementation is not consistent with this specification.

499703,PSEISV3,"Unify attribute\'s semantic kinds ""OnTheFly"" and ""None""","<p>Currently, object attributes may be of one of the follwing three semantic kinds:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>""none"": New/Set attribute values are taken over immediately and applied when acknowledged by the host application.</li>\r\n\t<li>""ChangeOnReset"": The attribute value can be written exactly once after a device reset has been performed. This type is not of further interest at this point.</li>\r\n\t<li>""OnTheFly"": New attribute value is taken over and applied right away by the stack. There are no further actions neccessary from the application side, except storing non volatile data.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, ""acknowledgement by the host"" is illustrated by the following example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>A Set_Attribute_Single service arrives from the bus</li>\r\n\t<li>The registered host application receives an object change indication addressing the attribute and containing the new attribute\'s value. Depending on the attribute semantic type, the new value may already have been ""applied"" (on-the-fly), or not (none). In any case, they were ""taken over"".</li>\r\n\t<li>The host replies to the change indication which causes the response to be send on the bus with a success status (independently of the return code passed back with the response to the change indication).</li>\r\n\t<li>The host itself invokes a Set_Attribute_Single service with the attribute address (class, instance, id) and the new data it received with the change indication, which causes the stack to ""apply"" the new attribute value for attributes of the semantic type ""none"" and which has no further meaningful effect for attributes of the semantic type ""OnTheFly"". This is the actual ""acknowledgement"".</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to simplify the control flow of the stack and to improve insight at the host application API level, the ""OnTheFly"" attribute semantic should be removed entirely. Instead, the operations ""new attribute value is taken over"" and ""new attribute value is applied"" should be unified into a single operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, attribute values should no longer be taken over instantly, but when the host acknowledges. This leads to the following new control flow:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>A Set_Attribute_Single service arrives from the bus</li>\r\n\t<li>The registered host application receives an object change indication addressing the attribute and containing the new attribute\'s value. The new value has not been taken over nor applied yet, it was just passed to the host in the object change indication.</li>\r\n\t<li>The host replies to the change indication with either a success or error status. This causes the response to be send on the bus with accordingly a success or failure status code.</li>\r\n\t<li>The host itself invokes a Set_Attribute_Single service with the attribute address (class, instance, id) and the new data it received with the change indication, which causes the stack to ""take over"" and ""apply"". This is the actual ""acknowledgement"". If the host decides to reject the attribute change it would not invoke a Set_Attribute_Single service.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with this change, we need to pay attention to the implementation of the Set_Attribute_List service, and we need to carefully consider the point in the control flow where remanent data is stored by the stack or the host itself.</p>\r\n",
498821,PSEISV3,Store remanent data in return path of object change indication instead of forward path,"<p>Currently, when an attribute is set in consequence of, e.g., a successful Set_Attribute_Single request from the bus, a change indication is generated towards the host.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nIn the send path of that change indication remanent storage of the new attribute value is requested in the background worker thread. Thus, it is not determined when exactly the remanent is actually written.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThere may be certain situations where this may lead to problems, e.g. if full power cycle reset is performed via the Identity object\'s reset service before the data could be written by the background worker (which may also be busy with other stuff in the meantime). This would result in remanent data not being stored despite of a successful Set_Attribute_Single service which has been replied to, for which the host was indicated and has responded.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nSolution: If we stick with asynchronous storage of remanent data, then we must synchronize the event ""remanent storing completed"" with at least the event ""power cycle will now be performed"" and maybe other ones, too.

This behavior is defined by the spec and is ok so far.\n7) Now the scanner needs to open a new tcp connection tcp_2 and encapsulation session encap_2 in order to be able \n   to close conn_2 (since tcp_1 and encap_1 have been closed already). \n8) Using tcp_2 and encap_2 the scanner sends a second forward_close request to the adapter using tcp_2 and encap_2.\n9) The adapter receives the second Forward_Close request, closes connection conn_2 but DOES NOT additionally closes encap_2 and tcp_2\n   since these are NOT linked to conn_2 (conn_2 was opened using tcp_1 and encap_1, which are already closed).\n   So all IO connections have been closed. There is only one tcp connection and one encapsulation session open (tcp_2 and encap_2).\n\n\nAt this point the adapter will be powered down. And after a while it will be powered up again.\nIn order to open the connections to the adapter real quick again (Quick Connect), the scanner knows\nthe exact time at which the adapter is ready to accept incoming connections again.\nSo after waiting for that time to run up the scanner now wants to open the connections conn_1 and conn_2 again.\nThe problem now is, that he tries to use tcp_2 and encap_2, which are still open from the scanners point of view.\nbut since the adapter was powered down and up, tcp_2 and encap_2 are not open on the adapter side.\n\nSo this is what happens then:\n\n10) The scanner sends a Forward_Open to open conn_1 using tcp_2 and encap_2.\n11) The adapter rejects this frame since he does not have any open tcp connections.\n12) The scanner runs into his internal scan list timeout and closes tcp_2 and encap_2.\n13) After some seconds ( time is scanner dependend) the scanner open a new tcp connection and \n    encapsulation session and all connection can be established again.\n\nThe the actual issue is that the scanner runs into that timeout (point 12). \nThis delays the quick connection buildup!\n\n\n###################################################################\nThis behavior can be seen in the attached WireShark trace:\n\nBoth connections conn_1 and conn_2 are running at the beginning of the capture.\n\nFrame #\n\n5545:\t\tThe scanner closes connection conn_1 (point 5 above)\n5546:\t\tAdapter acknowledges\n5547:\t\tAdapter closes encap_1 (internally) and tcp_1.

E.g. the RPI of the class3 connection is configured to be 1 second, but the PLC programm ony triggers CIP messages every 3 seconds. In that specific case the PLC will automatically send out CIP messages holding the previous sequence so that the RPI value is met and no connection timeout can occurr.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The probability of the error increases the more often CIP messages with a duplicate sequence count are handle by the stack. So if there is a scenario as describes above, the issue will definitelly show up after a couple of minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Error scenario:<br>\r\nWhen the issue shows up, the first thing that can be observed is, that at some point an incoming CIP request message is not answered anymore by the stack and the class3 connection runs into a timeout.
